# AVL-Map
Maps are powerful containers that combine key-value pairs in a specific order. They provide a way to organize and access elements by their keys, while associating each key with a corresponding value. The keys serve as unique identifiers and are used for sorting the elements within the map. Meanwhile, the values store the associated information tied to each key. It's worth noting that the key and value types can vary, but they are grouped together as a pair called value_type.

Internally, maps rely on a comparison object to enforce a specific ordering criterion for the keys. This ensures that the elements are always sorted accordingly. Although accessing individual elements by their key may be slower in maps compared to unordered_map containers, maps offer the advantage of allowing direct iteration over subsets based on their order.

Maps are commonly implemented as binary search trees, such as the AVL binary search tree. What sets maps apart from other associative containers is their ability to directly access the mapped value using the operator[].

In summary, maps provide an efficient and ordered way to store and retrieve key-value pairs, making them a valuable tool for various applications.
